        "\n",
        "1. **Translation:** The entire source code is converted into machine code **before execution** using a compiler.\n",

        "3. **Error Detection:** All syntax and semantic errors are detected **at compile time**.\n",
        "4. **Output:** Generates a separate executable file (e.g., `.exe` or `.out`).\n",

        "2. **Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * To prevent abrupt program termination.\n",
        "   * To provide meaningful error messages.\n",
        "   * To allow fallback operations or cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Common Exceptions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * `ZeroDivisionError` â€“ Division by zero.\n",
        "   * `FileNotFoundError` â€“ File not found.\n",
        "   * `TypeError` â€“ Operation on incompatible data types.\n",
        "   * `IndexError` â€“ List index out of range.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Syntax:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   try:\n",
        "       # Code that may raise an exception\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Used to define **cleanup actions** when an objectâ€™s lifecycle ends.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Automatic Invocation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Python automatically calls `__del__()` when there are **no more references** to the object.\n",
        "   * This usually happens when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted using `del`.\n",

        "\n",
        "   * Python allows variables to hold different types of data at different times, and memory is reallocated accordingly.\n",

        "5. **Private Heap Space:**\n",
        "\n",
